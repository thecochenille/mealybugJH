# R analyses for Vea et al.  (submitted PloS ONE)


##Summary
This folder includes all files for the R analyses performed in the manuscript: Vea et la. Differential juvenile hormone modulation establishes extreme sexual dimorphism in scale insects (for submission in PloS ONE)

## List of files
- [JHmealybug.Rmd](https://github.com/zourloubidou/mealybugJH/blob/master/JHmealybug.Rmd): R script that can be used directly in Rstudio
- [JHmealybug.md](https://github.com/zourloubidou/mealybugJH/blob/master/JHmealybug.md): this will display graphics when directly viewed in Github.
 
- expressionprofile.csv: data file including SDM quantity of each studied genes obtained from quantitative RT-PCR for samples of male and female mealybugs collected every 24 hour (cf. Materials and Methods, and supplementary pdf for details of experiments). List of variables as follows: 

- Pyri5mM.csv: data file including SDM quantity of each studied gene for prepupae and pupae treated with 5mM pyriproxyfen
